                    <p>
                      In this experiment you will see a series of colored beads being drawn out of an urn. You will have to decide what the color of the majority of beads in that urn is.
                      More detailed instructions will be provided if you decide to continue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We will also be checking how well you understand the instructions and the experiment.
                      We are genuinely interested in how well people understand the details of what's going on, so <b>please be honest</b> in your evaluation of how well you understand the task.
                      You will not be penalized for not understanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Finally, we'll ask you a few questions about your thoughts.

                      The results of this research will only be used for scientific purposes.
                      The results can be presented at conferences and can be published in scientific journals.
                      The results may also be published in newspapers, promotional material used by the university, or <a href="https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/psychology/home.aspx" target='_blank'>on the website of the university department</a>.
                      Finally, the data may be made available publically via the <a href='https://osf.io/' target='_blank'>Open Science Framework</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The data will never be shown in such a way that you could be personally identified, so it will include a randomly generated code instead of your Turk ID.
                      No personal information will ever be shared or linked to the data that you provide.
                      You may withdraw your data at any time prior to publication. If you wish to withdraw your data, please email us with either your Turk ID or the completion code you'll get at the end of the experiment.
                      If you are dissatisfied with any of these terms, please contact us via email (<a href='mailto:justin.sulik@rhul.ac.uk' target = '_top'>justin.sulik@rhul.ac.uk</a>).</p>

                      Participation in this experiment is voluntary. To collect your full payment, you will need to enter a completion code, which you will receive after the completion of the experiment.
                      Although you are free to withdraw your participation at any time, if you do not complete the experiment after consenting, you will not receive a completion code and will be unable to claim your payment.
